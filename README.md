- Airlines operate the flights. Every airline has an identity.
- The airline has different types of aircraft.
- Aircraft may be in operation or in a state of repair.
- Each flight has a unique identity, airport to take off and land at, and departure and landing times.
- Every flight has a pilot and co-pilot, and they operate the plane.
- Airports have unique IDs and names.
- Airlines have pilots, and each pilot has a level of experience.
- An aircraft type may need a certain number of pilots.
